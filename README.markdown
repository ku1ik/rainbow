About
-----

Rainbow extends ruby's String class adding methods to wrap the string with [ANSI escape codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

Features
--------

Rainbow adds following methods to String class:

* `foreground(color)` (with `color` and `colour` aliases)
* `background(color)`
* `reset`
* `bright`
* `italic` (not well supported by terminal emulators).
* `underline`
* `blink`
* `inverse`
* `hide`

Each of those methods returns string wrapped with some ANSI codes so you can chain calls as in example above.

Color can be one of following symbols:

``` ruby
:black, :red, :green, :yellow, :blue, :magenta, :cyan, :white, :default
```

If you have 256-colors capable terminal you can also specify color in RGB which will find the nearest match from 256 colors palette: 

```ruby
"Jolacz".color(115, 23, 98)
"Jolacz".color("#FFC482")
"Jolacz".color("FFC482")
```

For support on Windows, you should install the following gems:

```ruby
gem install windows-pr win32console
```

If the gems aren't installed strings are simply returned unaltered.

Rainbow can be disabled globally by setting:

```ruby
Sickill::Rainbow.enabled = false
```

It will be disabled by default if it detects that STDOUT is not a TTY.

Installation
------------

```ruby
gem install rainbow
```

Usage
-----

```ruby
require 'rainbow'
puts "this is red".foreground(:red) + " and " + "this on yellow bg".background(:yellow) + " and " + "even bright underlined!".underline.bright
```

Rails Usage
-----------

You're probably wanting to add colour to your logs. To do so you must explicity enable rainbow because it will detect that `STDOUT` (i.e.: the log file) is not a TTY.
To make things easy, create the file `config/initializers/rainbow.rb` and include the following:

```ruby
require 'rainbow'
Sickill::Rainbow.enabled = true
```
